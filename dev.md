# Develop

## 1. Code Style
We adopt [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) as the preferred code style.

We use the following toolsseed isortseed isortseed isort for linting and formatting:
- [flake8](http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/): linter
- [yapf](https://github.com/google/yapf): formatter
- [isort](https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort): sort imports

Style configurations of yapf and isort can be found in [setup.cfg](../../setup.cfg).
We use [pre-commit hook](https://pre-commit.com/) that checks and formats for `flake8`, `yapf`, `seed-isort-config`, `isort`, `trailing whitespaces`,
fixes `end-of-files`, sorts `requirements.txt` automatically on every commit.
The config for a pre-commit hook is stored in [.pre-commit-config](../../.pre-commit-config.yaml).
After you clone the repository, you will need to install initialize pre-commit hook.
```bash
pip install -r requirements/tests.txt
```
From the repository folder
```bash
pre-commit install
```

After this on every commit check code linters and formatter will be enforced.

If you want to use pre-commit to check all the files, you can run
```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```
